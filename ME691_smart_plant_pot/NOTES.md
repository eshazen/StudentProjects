## Email description 11/4/23

Hey Eric,

Thanks for getting back to us. Our project is a smart plant pot
system. The system will measure soil humidity, soil nutrients, and
light levels with the goal of helping users with growing their plants.

Currently, our two designs are at different levels of electrical
sophistication. The more sophisticated one will feature the following
electrical components:

* A moisture sensor
* An NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) sensor
* A light sensor (TBD based on price) 
* a 5 or 12V pump (TBD whether diaphragm, peristaltic, or other)
* An LED strip
* a PCBA with a transformer 
* A solenoid valve to control flow of water
* Indicator lights for user input

The second design will not feature a pump and solenoid valve. 

## Meeting 11/6/23

Met with Serge, Dancho, Jasmine.  They have two possible designs.  One
is the "plant hospital" which is a stand-alone thing which sits next
to a pot with sensors plugged in and inserted in the soil.  It would
monitor moisture and NPK and control a watering pump from a reservoir
and possibly lighting.

There is an alternative design which would be more passive, and they
didn't describe it in detail.

Talked a bit about PCB design issues and sent a link to my EDF website
with talks, etc.
